The dataset is a collation of accident reports for the Seattle metropolitan area.  It is a flat file (csv) that can read into various data science codes but Python will be the analytical language for this model.  The dataset contains 194,673 rows with 37 distinct fields.  There are more than enough data points to construct training and testing cohorts.
Not all of the fields are as relevant to building the model but several fields may be used:  latitude and longitude coordinates for mapping. Addresses and categorical data that lists the accident severities as well as date-time inputs.  There are weather conditions as well.  Much of the categorical data will have to be transformed for numeric inputs and there are conditions that lend themselves to clustering.
There is a column that can be utilized for Unique ID.  The data will have to be tidied prior to analysis and model construction, but the dataset does provide enough relevant information to conduct a supervised machine learning model that can predict accident severity.
