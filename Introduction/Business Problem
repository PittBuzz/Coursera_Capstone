Most major metropolitan areas are subject to multiple and seemingly unpredictable accidents that cause damage to people, automobiles and infrastructure.  The severity of these accidentâ€™s places strain on city services not to mention the toll on human beings.
A probabilistic machine learning program can help to mitigate the effects that these accidents have on the overall traffic flows of cities.  Private businesses, transportation services, and local governments would all benefit from optimizations to traffic patterns based on the predictability of accident severity. Costs in money, man-hours, and secondary accidents would be reduced.
